# Textualize layout spike

Research areas:

- primary: Layout
- secondary: TUI

Ggoals:

- primary: Multimodal UIs
	- multimodal have text, image multimedia, however... 
	- it seems that one the cornerstors is layout which connects the dots 
		- not the only one though, interaction is another, however: 
			- I define layout not just as 2D, but as 2+1D e.g. time-space, hence 
				- in this sense layout may support interaction understanding as well (how it effects interaction between UI and deeper with model)
		- another interesting thing here is styling, e.g. we want unified UI, where same/similar things have same/similar appereance -> 
			- styles beyond layout (e.g. colors), that is a later question
				- question: is there anything else than colors? 
					- beyond layout..., well in TUI font family is another thing, that is text styling
	- studying TUI is easier and text is essential, it was and due to ChatGPT it remains in focus
- secondary: UI understanding
