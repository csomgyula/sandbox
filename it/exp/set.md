- l-set is just set "in math"
- p-set is a physical set, as modeled in math:
  - has boundary
  - has elements (that is the l-set)
  - has an injective mapping from itself (boundary, elements) to physical world elements
- world can be a topology or some other structure, hence p-sets in a way reflect the world?

Container[Element, Atom]
- atoms: boundary, elements -> Set[Atom] or Set[Atom] -> boundary, elements
- boundary: Boundary[Atom]
- elements: Set[Element, Atom]
- axiom: atoms is an injections, that is each atom is either mapped to boundary or element or neither

Boundary[World]
- world_map self -> World
