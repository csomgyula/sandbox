## Goals

Experiment with writable, understandible, verifiable and executable language dealing with distributed systems, eg.: processes, many cores, IO, multiple layers, IO, core, UI, multiple machines and virtual machines, containers

Machine is considered as:

- pc(compute, hdd, nic, pc_ui)
	- compute(cpu, ram) 
	- pc_ui(monitor, mouse, keyboard, gpu, video ram)
	- cpu
	- ram
	- nic
	- hdd
	- monitor
	- mouse
	- keyboard
- plc

## Requirements

- human friendly: writeable (comprehensive), understandible, verifiable
- machine and environment friendly: lean
- multilayer/machine: compute, data, ui, network and iot at least as extension
- simple, turing complete
