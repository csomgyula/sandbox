# Virtual applied math machine

- is applied math
  - is math: can represent mathematical abstractions in a formal language
  - is applied: can model real life entities
- is virtual machine
  - is machine: has memory, can compute, visualize, interact 
  - is virtual: can run on multiple machines
  - environment-friendly: so it knows about its resources used
  - evolving: so it can evolve as machines evolve!!! that is the hardest part
